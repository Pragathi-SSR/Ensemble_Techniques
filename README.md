# Ensemble_Techniques
The objective of this ensemble learning project is to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models by combining multiple base models to create a more robust and accurate final model. By leveraging techniques such as bagging, boosting the project aims to reduce overfitting, enhance generalization across various datasets.
